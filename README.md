# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple command line program to play Tic Tac Toe.

I created this as a way of starting out with C++, it was generally not as easy as I thought but it turned out to be worth the effort!
## How To Play
Two players are required to play the game.
1. Enter each player's name
2. Choose a place for your token
3. Type in the number that corresponds to the place you chose
4. Keep playing until someone wins
